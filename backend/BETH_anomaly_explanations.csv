Closing a relatively high file descriptor (fd=10) can be suspicious because it often indicates cleanup of a network socket or redirected I/O from a child session rather than routine stdin/stdout/stderr (0/1/2); attackers frequently open and then close sockets or reassign FDs when establishing stealthy shells or C2 channels (relevant to ATT&CK tactics: Initial Access/Valid Accounts T1078 for SSH access and Command and Control T1041/T1090 patterns). It can also be part of post-exploitation cleanup or FD juggling used in process injection/IO redirection (T1055 / Defense Evasion) to hide activity. CONFIDENCE: medium — the evidence is ambiguous without context; missing pieces that would clarify intent are (1) which resource fd=10 referred to (socket vs file — i.e., prior open/connect events) and (2) parent/child lineage and recent network activity for PID 1407 (remote IPs, ports, and timestamps).",2025-11-10T05:06:40.956185

That file name looks like an SSH agent/forwarded-agent socket (agent.<pid>), so this could be benign cleanup when an SSH session or agent exits, especially since the filename contains the PID 1407 which matches the processId. Conversely, an attacker who abused SSH agent forwarding or a compromised sshd could delete the socket to remove traces or to disable/steal credentials — this maps to Defense Evasion (TA0005) / T1070.004 Indicator Removal on Host and is relevant to Credential Access (TA0006) / T1552 (unsecured credentials)/abuse of SSH agent. Confidence: medium — the evidence is ambiguous; missing context that would help: (1) session/login/logout events or child process activity around PID 1407 to show normal session termination, and (2) whether there were any suspicious network connections or subsequent lateral authentication attempts using the agent.",2025-11-10T05:06:55.138916
